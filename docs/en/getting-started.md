# Getting Started with Your Application

Welcome to your application's knowledge base! This is where you can document all the features and functionality of your system.

## What is the Knowledge Base?

The Knowledge Base is a powerful documentation system integrated directly into your Filament application. It allows you to:

- **Create comprehensive documentation** using Markdown files
- **Organize content** with categories and navigation
- **Search through documentation** using the global search feature
- **Access help directly** from within your application

## Creating Documentation

To create new documentation files, use the artisan command:

```bash
php artisan docs:make your-document-name
```

## Front Matter Options

Each documentation file can include front matter to customize how it appears:

- `title`: The display title of the document
- `icon`: Heroicon to display (e.g., `heroicon-o-book-open`)
- `order`: Numeric order for sorting
- `group`: Group name for categorization
- `parent`: Parent document for hierarchy

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Links and images
- Tables and quotes

> тЪая╕П **Tip:** The knowledge base supports special markers for highlighting important information!

## Getting Help

Look for the help button in your application interface to access this documentation system directly from any page.

Happy documenting! ЁЯЪА
