### Notes

- **Diamonds Theme**: All blade views must be created in `resources/views/diamonds/` directory to maintain theme consistency
- PHP controllers reference standard view paths (e.g., 'subscriber.login') but files are created in diamonds theme directory
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing when possible
- Use `php artisan test` to run all tests or `php artisan test --filter=SubscriberAuth` to run specific test classes
- File uploads will be stored in `storage/app/subscriber-content/` with tenant-specific subdirectories
- YouTube API integration will extend the existing `YouTubeApiService` from Settings.php
- Follow Filament best practices: avoid `HasForms` on custom resource pages, use modal forms in header actions instead
