Use Laravel 11+ skeleton structure.

**Service Providers**: there are no other service providers except AppServiceProvider. Don't create new service providers unless absolutely necessary. Use Laravel 11+ new features, instead. Or, if you really need to create a new service provider, register it in `bootstrap/providers.php` and not `config/app.php` like it used to be before Laravel 11.
**Event Listeners**: since Laravel 11, Listeners auto-listen for the events if they are type-hinted correctly.
**Console Scheduler**: scheduled commands should be in `routes/console.php` and not `app/Console/Kernel.php` which doesn't exist since Laravel 11.
**Middleware**: should be registered in `bootstrap/app.php` and not `app/Http/Kernel.php` which doesn't exist since Laravel 11.
**Tailwind**: in new Blade pages, use Tailwind and not Bootstrap. Tailwind is already pre-configured since Laravel 11, with Vite.

**Important: Location of the laravel app** The laravel app is in a directory called "saasykit-tenancy". All files for laravel and Filament are found there.

**Migrations**: When creating migrations, use terminal commands so the datestamp on the migrations is accurate.


If the code you're working on is written with Laravel Filament then please use the MCP servers like context7 or bravesearch to reference the relavant docs.
